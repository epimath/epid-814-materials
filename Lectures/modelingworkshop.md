## Thinking through the modeling process

- Overall questions
    - How to go from a question to a diagram to equations to code?
    - What kind of model to use under different circumstances?

- To do for each problem (discuss together)
    - Describe problem/model
    - What is the main question?
    - What processes are important?
        - biological processes, social processes
        - covariates
        - interventions
        - measurement
    - Structure model in general
        - draw diagram
        - decide what should be variables vs. parameters vs. forcing function inputs, etc.
    - Discuss how to math-matize the diagram to 
        - ODEs
        - stochastic models
        - ABMs
        - etc.
    - How to set parameters, inputs, & initial conditions?
        - What is known in the literature?
        - What data do you have/can you get? (i.e. parameter estimation y/n?)
        - Possibly sample from space of realistic parameters, estimate parameters, or maybe
