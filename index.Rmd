## Course schedule
Topics are subject to change and rearrangement! (We may also not get to all the topics listed)

<br>

##### 1. Parameter estimation and maximum likelihood (9/9/19 and 9/11/19)

- Maximum likelihood with mathematical models - [Lecture](Lectures/ParameterEstimationML.pdf) (9/9/2019)

- Parameter estimation coding session - [Lab](Labs/EstimationLab/) (9/11/2019)

<br>

##### 2. Math modeling how-to workshop (9/16/19)
- Main ideas

    - **How to go from a question to a diagram to equations to code?**

    - What kind of model to use under different circumstances?
   
- **To Do**: Everyone bring a specific question that they might want to use a model to answer, and we'll workshop it together for the 9/16/19 class. 
    
    - Think about what knowledge about the system you have---what are the causal processes? What features/variables/processes might be important to include to answer your question? What do you think we might be able to ignore or simplify out?

    - Also, if you think you might want to estimate parameters for the model, think a about what kind of data you might want to use! What can you measure/observe, e.g. through epidemiological studies or biological experiments?

- We will go through each question/problem together and discuss how we might build a model that can answer that question, what the assumptions and limitations of different kinds of models are, etc.

- [Discussion prompts](Lectures/modelingworkshop.md)

<br>

##### 3. Uncertainty and identifiability

- Identifiability and parameter uncertainty - [Lecture](Lectures/IdentifiabilityUncertainty.pdf) 

- [Useful post on Wald/FIM vs. Likelihood-based confidence intervals](https://thestatsgeek.com/2014/02/08/wald-vs-likelihood-ratio-test/)

- Identifiability and uncertainty lab
<!--[Identifiability and uncertainty Lab](Labs/IdentifiabilityUncertainty/IdentifiablilityUncertaintyLab.html)-->

<br>


##### 4. Intro to MCMC & Bayesian approaches

- Intro to Bayesian Approaches to Parameter Estimation <!-- - [Lecture](Lectures/BayesianEstimation.pdf)-->

- MCMC Introduction and Lab <!-- - [Lab - Metropolis Sampler](Labs/MetropolisSampler/MetropolisSampler.html)-->


<br>

##### 5. Digging in to Bayesian estimation for mathematical models

- BayesianTools Lab <!--[BayesianTools Lab](Labs/BayesianToolsLab/BayesianTools.html)-->

<br>

##### 6. Visualization with ggplot2

- Intro to ggplot and collection of examples <!--[Lab - our collection of ggplot examples](Labs/ggplotExamples/)-->

- [Nice ggplot tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html)

<br>

##### 7. Data-scraping and data-wrangling 
(moved this up since it might be useful for making data sets we can play with for the ML and networks sections below)

- Using R to pull data using API's - Twitter, Facebook, and Google Maps

- Collecting and working with twitter data

- An [interesting article](https://howwegettonext.com/scientists-like-me-are-studying-your-tweets-are-you-ok-with-that-c2cfdfebf135) about the ethics of using public data and our perception of privacy

<br>

##### 8. Basic intro to some useful algorithms/machine learning methods
- Introduction, definitions, jargon
- K-means clustering
- Support vector machines
- Singular value decomposition (possibly a little linear algebra review also?)
- Basic neural networks

<br>

##### 9. Network analysis and network modeling
- Review of network concepts (centrality, modularity, etc.)
- Network simulation methods (Barabasi-Albert, Erdos-Renyi, etc.)
- Configuration models
- Build example network simulation models (e.g. infection/behavior spread on a network)

<br>

##### 10. Stochastic models
- Ideas, Markov models
- Gillespie algorithm
- Tau-leaping
- Possibly discuss hybrid models, journal club some of [Linda Allen's book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Stochastic-Processes-Applications-Biology-ebook/dp/B005H6YSNM)
