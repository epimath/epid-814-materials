## Course schedule
Topics are subject to change and rearrangement! (We may also not get to all the topics listed)

<br>

##### 1. Parameter estimation and maximum likelihood (9/9/19 and 9/11/19)

- Maximum likelihood with mathematical models - [Lecture](Lectures/ParameterEstimationML.pdf) (9/9/2019)

- Parameter estimation coding session - [Lab](Labs/EstimationLab/) (9/11/2019)

<br>

##### 2. Math modeling how-to workshop (9/16/19)
- Main ideas

    - **How to go from a question to a diagram to equations to code?**

    - What kind of model to use under different circumstances?
   
- **To Do**: Everyone bring a specific question that they might want to use a model to answer, and we'll workshop it together for the 9/16/19 class. 
    
    - Think about what knowledge about the system you have---what are the causal processes? What features/variables/processes might be important to include to answer your question? What do you think we might be able to ignore or simplify out?

    - Also, if you think you might want to estimate parameters for the model, think a about what kind of data you might want to use! What can you measure/observe, e.g. through epidemiological studies or biological experiments?

- We will go through each question/problem together and discuss how we might build a model that can answer that question, what the assumptions and limitations of different kinds of models are, etc.

- [Discussion prompts](Lectures/modelingworkshop.md)
