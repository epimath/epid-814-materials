## Thinking through the modeling process

- Overall questions
    - How to go from a question to a diagram to equations to code?
    - What kind of model to use under different circumstances?

- To do for each problem (discuss together)
    - Describe problem/model
    - What is the main question?
    - What processes are important?
        - Biological processes, social processes
        - Covariates
        - Interventions
        - Measurement
    - Structure model in general
        - Draw diagram
        - Decide what should be variables vs. parameters vs. forcing function inputs, etc.
    - Discuss how to math-matize the diagram to 
        - ODEs
        - Stochastic models
        - ABMs
        - Etc.
    - What output variables (outcomes, quantities of interest) should I track?
    - How to set parameters, inputs, & initial conditions?
        - What is known in the literature?
        - What data do you have/can you get? (i.e. parameter estimation y/n?)
        - Possibly sample from space of realistic parameters, estimate parameters, or maybe just choose specific representative parameters to illustrate the main ideas
